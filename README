bwping(8)                   System Manager's Manual                  bwping(8)

NAME
       bwping  and  bwping6  are tools to measure bandwidth and response times
       between two hosts using Internet Control Message Protocol  (ICMP)  echo
       request/echo reply mechanism.

SYNOPSIS
       bwping  [  -4  |  -6  ]  [  -B  bind_addr ] [ -I ident ] [ -T tos(v4) |
       traf_class(v6) ] [ -r reporting_period ] [ -u buf_size  ]  -b  kbps  -s
       pkt_size -v volume target

       bwping6  [  -4  |  -6  ]  [  -B bind_addr ] [ -I ident ] [ -T tos(v4) |
       traf_class(v6) ] [ -r reporting_period ] [ -u buf_size  ]  -b  kbps  -s
       pkt_size -v volume target

OPTIONS
       -4   Forces IPv4 mode. Default mode of operation is IPv4 for bwping and
            IPv6 for bwping6 otherwise.

       -6   Forces IPv6 mode. Default mode of operation is IPv4 for bwping and
            IPv6 for bwping6 otherwise.

       -B bind_addr
            Sets  the  source  address  of outgoing ip packets. By default the
            address of the outgoing interface will be used.

       -I ident
            Sets the Identifier value of outgoing ICMP Echo  Request  packets.
            If  zero, the value of the lower 16 bits of the process ID will be
            used (default).

       -T tos(v4) | traf_class(v6)
            Sets the TOS (in IPv4 mode) or Traffic Class (in IPv6 mode)  value
            of outgoing ip packets. Default value is zero.

       -r reporting_period
            Sets the interval time in seconds between periodic bandwidth, RTT,
            and loss reports. If zero,  there  will  be  no  periodic  reports
            (default).

       -u buf_size
            Sets  the size of the socket send/receive buffer in bytes. If zero
            (default), the system default will be used. Tune this parameter if
            the  speed measurement results are unexpectedly low or packet loss
            occurs.

       -b kbps
            Sets the transfer speed in kilobits per second.

       -s pkt_size
            Sets the size of  ICMP  packet  (excluding  IPv4/IPv6  header)  in
            bytes.

       -v volume
            Sets the volume to transfer in bytes.

BUGS
       None known.

NOTES
       These  tools  use  raw  sockets to deal with ICMP messages, so they may
       require root privileges or extended capabilities (such  as  CAP_NET_RAW
       on Linux) to run. They can also be run as setuid root.

       Although  bwping  and  bwping6 does not require any special software on
       the remote host (only the ability  to  respond  on  ICMP  echo  request
       messages),   there   are   some   special   requirements   to   network
       infrastructure, local and remote host performance:

       1. There should be no ICMP echo request/reply filtering on the network.
       This includes QoS mechanisms (which often affects ICMP) at any point in
       the testing path;

       2. Local host should have  enough  CPU  resources  to  send  ICMP  echo
       request  messages  with  given  rate,  and  remote  host should quickly
       respond on these messages and should have no  ICMP  bandwidth  limiting
       turned on.

       3. Each bwping and bwping6 process should use its own ICMP Echo Request
       Identifier value  to  reliably  distinguish  between  ICMP  Echo  Reply
       packets destined for each of these processes.

       If  some  of  these requirements are not satisfied then the measurement
       results will be inadequate or fail completely. In general, for  testing
       bandwidth  where  QoS  is  implemented,  always  test with traffic that
       matches the QoS class to be tested.
